## NX Monorepo

```text
    Scalability: NestJS is organized around modules and services, making it a breeze to scale.
    Consistency: With Nx, both frontend and backend share the same tooling and configuration approach.
    Efficiency: Nx’s caching and dependency graph make your build and test processes much faster.
    Single Repo Magic: One repository for the entire stack — no more jumping between separate repos.
```
